# VANILLA TEMPLATE 
This is a vanilla template for what my projects would look like, it has everything & anything. It is not sectioned/categorized so it's more so a practice template for future templates I might make in the future. #alearningtemplate. 

## Things to note 
1. Most of this is just a skeleton with no real files in it, hence a template.  
2. In my test folder unit folder actually stands for unit & intergation tests put together in one test. Ideally you should have a separate unit test & another intergration test but i noticed i usually end up writing all my tests be it unit or intergration in one file. So yes, note that. 
3. I'll slowly be making this better the more I learn 🤞
